      My name is Long Nguyen. I was born in Vietnam and moved to Iowa when I was 9 years old. I started getting into programming when I was in 6th grade after playing a particular game called 'Tibia'. Back then, people would create their own private server (Basically a replicated version of the game) and host it on their machine / paid server so others can join and play. Though, what's different about it is that its customizable so that your playing the same game, but with different features. The programming language I started with is LUA. Afterwards, I grew away from it as I no longer have time to invest into game development. Recently over the past few years, I been learning c, Python, Ruby, Powershell, Java to broaden my knowledge. I haven't been focusing on a particular programming language as of yet. But now that I have joined a coding bootcamp regarding to Java, I hope this can be the first step of my development career path so I can branch off to other languages for years to come.

      For now, I like to keep my options open whether I'll get into Game Development or Software Development.
